# 🚀 My Machine Learning Journey  

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my complete **Machine Learning journey** step by step.  
This repo is a collection of notes, practice codes work on as I progress from **Python basics** to **advanced ML concepts**.  

The goal is to create a structured learning path for myself (and anyone following along) and to track my growth as I learn new concepts and tools.
